            A popular and sacred ceremonial tradition in Madagascar, Famadihana translated means “the turning of the bones”. It is a funerary tradition of the Malagasy people. In the duration of the ceremony, you dig and take out the bodies of your ancestors from the family crypts and wrap them around with fresh cloth, often fine silk with their names written on it. They then dance to music while carrying the corpses over their heads, they do this to celebrate the life that was lived by the deceased.
            
            Famadihana is a fairly recent tradition picked up by the Malagasy people, believed to have its origins in Southeast Asia and Oceania, it was introduced to the Malagasy people around the 17th century. Today, it is celebrated around every five to seven years in Madagascar, and has become a regular ritual where you can bring together family to celebrate your kinship.
            
            Sadly, the celebrations of Famadihana are on the decline due to the steep costs of the fine silk and the Malagasy people are increasingly believing that the practices of the sacred tradition are getting outdated.
